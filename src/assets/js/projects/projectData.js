      "To generate results, the app is comparing potential processing dates against the non-working days provided via API call (weekends and bank holidays), as well as company-specific holiday dates input by the user. If the 2 match, the app needs to not only shift the date backwards or forwards, but re-calculate the shift until there is no longer a clash. This required some complex nested looping logic, and testing for edge cases, including those where a non-processing day (or days) land(s) between dates where one needs to be 3 working days prior to another.",
      "The dates calculated in each column are dependent on each other - results are not always isolated to a specific calendar year, but can be impacted by e.g. non-processing dates in the previous calendar year, or can impact the subsequent calendar year. This therefore needed to be built into the app's logic as well.",
      "Updating from vanilla JS/BootStrap to a fully-fledged React application meant not only a refactoring of UI elements (taking advantage of modular component structure and dynamic rendering), but restructuring the app's functionality, as React works with a virtual DOM rather than the traditional DOM. This was a challenge but at the same time, a great exercise in <em>design thinking</em> - analysing the app's process flow, simplifying and breaking down functions and UI elements further where necessary, improving clarity and reusability.",
      "Refactoring was helped by having already written unit tests, expressing what each function should achieve. Conditional rendering logic could now be handled by components themselves, rather than arising from other functions, allowing for a clearer separation of concerns. The React <a href='https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext'>Context API</a> also allowed me to maintain greater control and a clearer overview of state management throughout the app, without overly complicated interactions and unwanted side effects.",
      "Testing the 'copy to clipboard' function in Vitest involved some extra complexity without certain DOM elements in a testing environment. I nonetheless managed this by: <li>Mocking the navigator object using 'vi' in Vitest;</li><li>Mocking the document object using <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom'>JSDOM</a></li>",
      "To make the app's output more predictable, I opted to change the <b>data structure</b> of each function's returned output so that they followed a consistent schema. In turn, my tests greatly supported my overall debugging process, as they involved checking the data structure as well as type-checking.",

      "While my eventual unit-test coverage was close to 100%, I learned first-hand that this is not the only metric for effective tests - there is always room to improve their quality and handling of edge cases. An app can also benefit from integration and end-to-end testing where possible. In this case, I mocked integration testing using data to ensure the app's output would be correct.

      "Apart from being the most complex and comprehensive app I have worked on to-date, this was my first time working with a 'full-stack' of tech, from front-end layout design, to server-side frameworks like Express, and databases like MongoDB. This naturally taught me a great deal about approaches to troubleshooting and problem-solving.",
      "The interdependence between the many changing parts of a full-stack application, from front-end to back-end, definitely introduces more complexity than with a simpler single-page application. Introducing extra features began to 'break' other parts of the application in unexpected ways.",
      "For example, adding image uploading functionality impacted the back-end validation required for creating new campgrounds - this was dependent on a specific data model, which had now been modified to handle file uploads. The isssue was initially difficult to diagnose, as it returned 'undefined' errors rather than standard validation errors. This really highlighted the importance of testing and debugging at every stage of development, as well as clear error handling. I found that taking a modular approach to app-building made it far easier to isolate the issue to specific files/functions, in tandem with Git version control, which allowed me to identify the specific changes triggering the issue.",
      "As an 'unopinionated' framework, Express is very flexible to work with, but with this naturally comes the potential for undesired issues. Working with middleware required some careful consideration in terms of program flow. Defining my own error-handling middleware was certainly very helpful for logging and debugging, but also chaining these correctly was crucial - at one point, failing to use 'next()' in a simple logger caused a lot of extra problems!",
      "Building an app with a large number of features not only introduces many different options, but adds complexity when bridging the gap between different tech that can achieve similar things. For example, there are many ways to approach validation for form data. After adding both BootStrap validation and JOI server-side validation, there was some conflict - while my front-end markup did not define all fields as 'required', JOI still expected non-empty values, so would throw errors. I therefore had to update my JOI schema to explicitly allow certain empty fields, keeping the two 'in sync.' There were also some complications with review star ratings, whereby a '0' star rating would fail validations, and some extra considerations needed when working with data models that included nested objects.",
      "This was my first time deploying an app to a 'live' production environment outside of GitHub Pages, so I needed to familiarise myself with the <a href='https://www.heroku.com/'>Heroku</a> ecosystem, including how to securely apply environment variables. I also needed to consider the separation between development and production environments, in terms of securely handling 'real' user data, and testing before deployment.",
    ],
    lessons: [
      "The scope of this project was large, and I learned a lot about the many considerations that go into building a full-stack CRUD application.",
      "Overall, the project was a really good exercise in breaking an app down into all of its component parts, while also understanding how they interrelate. I learned how to approach app-building in a modular way - through templating pages, and by creating middleware that can be re-used throughout the app. This avoids duplicating code, and makes things cleaner, easier to read and maintain - really important for projects of any size! One approach taken was using the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller'>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</a> design pattern, which taught me how to practically implement a 'separation of concerns' for different parts of the app.",
      "YelpCamp taught me, first-hand, the benefits of using <a href='https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-restful-routes-in-nodejs'>RESTful routing patterns</a> as a blueprint for the app's CRUD functionality, making the app easier to structure, understand, and ultimately, maintain. This was achieved by linking each user interaction with an associated HTTP verb (e.g. get, post, put, delete), which maps the client-side to an associated server-side function.",
      "In setting up login/register functionality for users, I learned about ways to authenticate users by securely storing their password and other data (with encryption), and using this to confirm their login. I then considered authorization - in addition to requiring a login to access certain content or functions in general, the app would need to apply specific permissions depending on the user, and use server-side security measures to restrict access, as well as hiding content.",
      "To implement this authorization, I needed to make HTTP requests 'stateful' using session and cookie data, which means allowing the app to remember the status of a logged in user and their permissions. This is achieved server-side using session data (with <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session'>express-session</a>), and passed to the client for cookie-based authentication. To enable cookie signing and parsing, I used the <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser'>cookie-parser</a> middleware.",
      "The project was a great introduction to data models and relationships. In Mongo, I established a link between models for campgrounds, campground authors, reviews and review authors, using referencing that I built into each data 'schema.' This worked very effectively for a 'one to many' data relationship, such as campgrounds and their associated reviews. In future I hope to explore the possibilities of more complex 'two-way referencing,' as well as comparing with an SQL-based approach.",
      "I learned how to effectively 'seed' my database in a testing environment, which I needed to do multiple times throughout development as my app's data structure evolved. I used the <a href='https://unsplash.com/developers'>Unsplash Source API</a> to fetch a series of images from a collection, and populated the rest of the data with randomised location names, descriptors, and geocoding data.",
      "While there is plenty more to expore in this area, the project taught me how to address many security concerns, such as database injections, cross-site scripting, and cookie theft. Methods for addressing this included but were not limited to: 'sanitizing' form inputs to prevent unwanted HTML scripting, protecting cookie data by making it accessible via HTTP only, hiding stack trace errors, encrypting password and user data, setting HTTP response headers and a content security policy for resources (using <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet?activeTab=readme'>Helmet</a>), and protecting server-side routes from unwanted or unauthorized requests.",
      "Finally, the scope for improving any app is huge, and there are many potential future considerations - for example, further security concerns, requiring server-side limits image uploads and other app usage, and many potential design/UX improvements.",

My solution involved creating a fixed 'board' of tiles which could register the position of the user's mouse click, as well as a means of breaking up a source image into tiles, tracked with their own index numbers as they move. When the user clicks a tile, the program would need to find the location of the blank tile, before swapping their positions (the canvas actually 'redraws' on each click).",
      "The toughest challenge was discovered during testing- I learned that in some cases, randomised tile placement meant the puzzle was actually unsolvable. The solution involved reverse-engineering from a completed puzzle, with rules imposed so that each step of the 'shuffle' could only happen if the randomly-selected tile was adjacent to a blank tile, and swapping with it directly. This also required a greater amount of randomization, because there are fewer possibilities for movement on each iteration. As a result I built in a randomization index to quickly test the impact of the number of individual shuffle 'attempts' on the overall level of shuffling, and potentially the difficulty of the puzzle.",

The interaction between this regular pulse and the irregular (or regular) user-generated pattern is key to the Schillinger rhythm system - the 2 patterns will go in and out of phase, or sync, but return to their original relationship at certain intervals. Schillinger calls these <b>'interference patterns'</b>, referring to the relationship between simultaneous rhythmic patterns. We hear many of these rhythms in nature, and this method is therefore an interesting way of conceptualising it and applying it to musical composition.",

      "How are the <b>numerical patterns</b> generated? Each individual number in the sequence defines the 'length' of a beat - for example: <ul><li>'0' contains no information for beats or rests, and is therefore ignored;</li><li>'1' defines a single beat which is followed immediately by another beat/number;</li><li>'2' defines a beat followed by a rest, taking up 2 beat divisions in total;</li><li>'3' defines a beat followed by a rest of 2 beat divisions, taking up 3 beat divisions in total;</li><li>'4 defines a beat followed by a rest of 3 beat divisions, taking up 4 beat divisions in total;</li><li>etc.</li></ul>",
      "The pattern is translated into a pattern in the app's drum sequencer, an interface which should be immediately familiar to many musicians. This can then be edited dynamically by the user to experiment with different patterns, adding or removing beats for each instrument/sample.",
      "Once the pattern has been created, the app will ultimately allow the musician to alter it in a number of interesting and idea-inspiring ways, or <b>'mutations'</b> (to be added). Schillinger's 'interference patterns' work with symmetry, so the ability to convert a pattern into a symmetrical one will be a key feature, alongside further 'preset' tweaking options:<ul><li>Rotating the pattern;</li><li>A 'regen' option to generate an alternative version of the pattern;</li><li>Changing the instrumentation, i.e. samples;</li><li>Change the character of the pattern - e.g. slow, or offbeat;</li><li>Different musical divisions or time signatures</li></ul>",

      "For audio, I identified <a href='https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound'>p5.sound</a> as the most compatible tool, as it extends p5 with <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API'>Web Audio</a> functionality. Most importantly, it includes useful and flexible methods for handling playback of samples in the form of sequences or patterns.",

      "Inconsistent <b>playback speed</b> - for a rhythm-based app this could be quite an issue! By default, the grid-based patterns do not play back 'on beat' but rather slow down or speed up erratically, like a drunken drummer. I therefore needed to pass in a scheduled delay time to produce a clock time that would be consistent with the sample rate. I also added some artificial latency to the visual playhead so that this was in sync with the speed of audio playback.",
      "The <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API'>Web Audio API</a>, which is used for audio playback in the browser, comes with some <b>policy restrictions</b> - understandably, auto-playback is restricted and the API therefore expects some form of explicit user interaction in order to allow permission to play audio. In practice, finding a way to consistently 'suspend' audio playback on page load across browsers (and therefore avoid error which break the app) was unexpectedly challenging, but I was able to find a method that mimics Google's autoplay policy.",
      // "Clicking cells in the sequencer grid allows the user to update the pattern as the sequence plays. I therefore needed my app to dynamically update both the visual grid and the sound sequence, without interrupting playback by 'refreshing' the browser.",
      "Working with <b>patterns of differing lengths</b> (i.e. a user-defined sequence length which is longer or shorter than the length of the numerical input pattern) - the 'interference' between the two is core to what makes Schillinger rhythms interesting, but also introduces some very <b>complex logic</b>. If the two differ, the visual sequencer pattern would also need to update dynamically on each 'cycle'. This involves accounting for a number of scenarios and <b>design decisions</b>:<ul><li>If the sequence length is set to be <em>longer</em> than the input pattern, the pattern itself needs to cycle within the longer sequence, while the sequence display needs to update on each cycle of the playhead. A simpler alternative would have been to add rests to the pattern to 'fill' the remainder of the sequence, so that the same pattern repeats on each cycle - but this is far less interesting and doesn't take full advantage of the variation in 'interference patterns'.</li><li>If the sequence length is set to be <em>shorter</em> than the original input pattern, the sequence on display needs to be 'refreshed' more frequently. A simpler alternative would be to truncate the pattern, but again this limits variation.</li><li>If the sequence length is <em>much longer</em> than the input pattern, this requires multiple cycles within a sequence, adding further complexity.</li></ul>",

      "This has been a great experience in <b>collaboration</b>, working together to understand the aims and ideas of the client, and communicating with them the technical challenges or steps needed to translate these into functioning code. I set out a plan covering the features that were in scope for the project, and laid out the development stages needed to build a successful app, working through them iteratively.",
      "One key takeaway from this project has been that there are many ways that a user can 'break' an app or interact with it in unexpected ways, so creating a robust UI/UX that allows for flexible interaction is really important. This made me think about the importance of <b>usability</b> in any application - making it simple and intuitive, while not forcing the user to overthink. There are some key principles in Steve Krug's <a href='https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515'>Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web and Mobile Usability</a> (strongly recommended!) which I intend to implement in future iterations of this app, including: <ul><li>Don't make the user think - use of the app should be self-evident and a new user should be able to explore it intuitively, without friction or confusion.</li><li>Avoid instructions, or keep them short and simple. I have initially kept detailed instructions on the app's front page for ease of development and demonstration, but these will be replaced with UI features and a clearer visual hierarchy to highlight the app's most important features.</li><li>Regular usability testing - this helps to challenge development assumptions when used in the 'real world,' and continuous testing allows for continuous improvement.</li></ul>",
