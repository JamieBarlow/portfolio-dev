    Hi there! I’m Josh. I’m a passionate introvert who loves building things with code. 
    My first experience with programming was when I was 12, but I didn’t last long: I was a big fan of computer-animated TV shows like Reboot, and I decided I wanted to do “computer graphics”. My mom bought me a C++ Reference Manual. It was several hundred pages, and totally inscrutable to me.
    Years later, I decided to try learning Python. It was a radically different experience. I distinctly remember the moment it clicked; I was watching The Price is Right, and they were spinning the big wheel. A contestant landed on 0.70, and it made me wonder: statistically, what was their best move? 
    It occurred to me: I had the skills to build a simulation! So I threw together a Python script that would run thousands of simulations to work out what the right answer was. 15 minutes later, I had the answer. My burgeoning skillset was a superpower: I could derive answers that were previously off-limits to me. It was magic. Since then, I’ve been honing my skills and learning Javascript. I recently graduated from Apex College’s 12-week intensive Web Development Bootcamp program. I’m seeking a full-time role where I can help a company achieve their goals.
    

    As a young teenager, I was always looking for creative projects to get stuck into. Like many kids, I was into games, so naturally I built a website related to the PlayStation 2 –  an incredibly powerful, state-of-the-art console with photo-realistic graphics (this is how it felt to a kid at the time – the leap from previous console generations was pretty staggering). I had also discovered the possibilities of the Personal Computer. I was a tinkerer, but resources (and internet access – was on dial-up) were so limited that it didn’t feel like a reasonable academic or career option. I had to build the site using a couple of tutorials on HTML, and structure the site with HTML tables, and reverse-engineering layout code built in a demo/trial copy of FrontPage Express (the grownups were using DreamWeaver).
    Years later, focusing on music software – I realised that I was using a ‘logical editor,’ writing scripts, and programming songs with samples and beats. Technology had come a long way. I was also in a heavily process-driven role, and I enjoyed problem-solving by writing programs and macros (eventually leading to my JS DD Calendar app).
    Wanted a new challenge, but this brought me full-circle and I found that I was really enjoying learning to code – seeing a lot of creative possibilities.
    I still love video games.
